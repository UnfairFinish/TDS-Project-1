#TDS Project 1

- I used a python code to scrape the data using my GitHub token from api.github.com and to clean the data.
- It is interesting that SQL is one of the least popular programming languagues among the users and yet it has the highest average number of stars per repository.
- The regression slope of followers on bio word count is negative, which means that the shorter the bio, the higher the followers, the developer would gain.

Details about the uploaded files: 

* The source code for scraping and cleaning the data is provided in `script.py` file.
* The source codes for analyzing the data is given in the `codes.txt` file.
* `users.csv` contains the details of 471 users who are living in Boston and has more than 100 followers.
